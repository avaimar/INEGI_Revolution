# INEGI Revolution

## Overview
The objective of this project is to clean, process and analyze public, non-confidential Census data as 
efficiently as possible from the Mexican National Statistics Institute (INEGI). We seek to make these processed 
databases available to the public such that a user may select a group of variables of interest and 
make immediate use of them for analysis/visualization by removing the need to preprocess and merge this data.
Moreover, we seek to generate municipality-level (a municipality is a Mexican territorial unit smaller than the 32
states in which Mexico is divided into) index cards with a selected group of variables that will summarize and 
visualize this data for a selected municipality. 

## Setup
Head over to the [INEGI website](https://www.inegi.org.mx/programas/cngf/2019/) and from the table on the left-hand
side select a particular Census and year from which to extract data. On the right-hand menu, select the Microdata tab
and click on the link to download all of the included files (*"Descargar todos los archivos"*).
